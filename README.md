## Introduction 
As the aviation industry expands, it must continually evolve to meet the demands of the changing market. In such a competitive industry, managing the challenge of high operational costs, with fuel, maintenance, and route selection, is critical to maintain profitability and customer satisfaction. Airlines are progressively turning to analytical methods instead of conventional ones to optimize their operations. One example of this is the use of path planning algorithms that may help identify the most cost-effective route a plane can take. In this project, we will focus on improving the A* algorithm to model and solve profitable routing scenarios in aviation.
